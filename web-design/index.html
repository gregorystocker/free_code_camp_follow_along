      <p>
        My name is Gregory Stocker, I am an aspiring web developer.
        I am planning on learning full stack web development. I have a beginner
        grasp on html and CSS. I am also learing Wordpress so that I can build up
        my portfolio, but I would like to be developing in React, Angular and Vue
        as well as Node.js and MongoDB.
      </p>

      <h2>
        Here`s some things that i`ve been working on while following the freecodecamp
        curriculum:
      </h2>
      <h3>Heres some form elements like buttons:</h3>

<!--the input and button use the form element to communicate with server
the input gets the users input and the button submits that text the action
attribute tells it where to send the data
required means the user has to input something to submit-->
      <form name="submitting" action="/index.js">
        <input type="text" placeholder="this is placeholder text" required>
        <button type="submit">submit</button>
      </form>
<!--The HTML <label> element represents a caption for an item in a user interface.
each radio box needs it`s own label
the name attribute in the label should describe the choice and the
name attribute in the inputs need to be the same for them to communicate-->
<label name="thing1">
    <input type="radio" name="things">thing1</input>
  <label>
    <label name="thing2">
        <input type="radio" name="things">thing2</input>
      <label>
<br>
<!--again the name attribute in the input elements needs to be the same
to communicate
putting checked makes the box checked by default but its not working for some
reason-->
        <label>
          <input type="checkbox" name="options" checked>
          a
        </label>
        <label>
          <input type="checkbox" name="options" checked>
          b
        </label>
        <label>
          <input type="checkbox" name="options">
          c
        </label>

    <h2>
      Here`s some stuff I can do with positioning.
    </h2>

    <p>
      these are inline block level elements. Divs that I lined up next to each other.
      <br> their container-divs (the black boxes) are also displayed as inline-block.
      <br>I set the second box`s white inner boxes margin to a negative value.
      This made them bigger, and since they were all the way up next to the black boxes
      left side, this pushed the right black box out of alignment with the left as well
      as overlap one another.
